/** Small map features that are often mapped as points and usually cannot be entered.
 *
 *  To demarcate this category from others, the following are not included:
 *  - structures that are big enough that they would rather be classified alongside buildings
 *    (e.g. water towers)
 *  - permanent features of the landscape (e.g. geysers, peaks, springs)
 *  - things that are features on other map features that wouldn't make sense on their own (e.g.
 *    crossings, traffic lights, entrances, golf holes)
 *  - things that should not be mapped as points - even if allowed - and landuses (e.g. car parks,
 *    dog parks, playgrounds)
 *
 *  Additionally, these things are generally not included:
 *  - things that are intangible / difficult to verify on-site (e.g. fishing spots)
 *  - things that would just be madness to comprehensively map (e.g. manhole covers), maybe what's
 *    madness to map or not is in the eye of the beholder, in this case, in the eyes of app
 *    maintainers
 *
 *  Important: The contribution policy here is that only things may be added if an iD preset for it
 *             exists. This policy exists in order to reduce effort to maintain this list, i.e. we
 *             don't want to check, weigh and balance requests in parallel to iD maintainers (in
 *             terms of notability, it being unambiguous, consensus etc.)

       possible.
       In particular, it is not clear what "segregated" refers to on a path that potentially allows
       access to all three modes of travel and when re-tagging e.g. an exclusive cycleway to a
       non-designated one, it is unclear whether foot=yes or horse=yes or both should be added. So,
       this data model can only be about the relation between foot & bicycle, not about all three.

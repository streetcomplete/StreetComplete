package de.westnordost.streetcomplete.overlays

/** Default and common colors for overlays. This palette is selected to be suitable for use by
 *  color-blind people too, that is
 *
 *  - Red-green color blindness: Deutan, Protan (~4.5% of population)
 *  - Blue-yellow color blindness (but not as good): Tritan (~0.01% of population)
 *
 *   See the palette here (update link if colors are updated!):
 *   https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23444444-%23FF0000-%231A87E6-%232FACE8-%2330D4EE-%2310C1B8-%230DA082-%23F37D1E-%23EEBD0D-%23B6EF28
 *
 *   The palette is loosely based on Color Universal Design (CUD) by Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito's
 *   color palette (https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/), compare:
 *   https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind/#%23000000-%230072B2-%2356B4E9-%23CC79A7-%23009E73-%23D55E00-%23E69F00-%23F0E442-%23DDDDDD
 *
 *   However,
 *   - the colors have been made more vibrant
 *   - and a few added
 *   - balanced to not be too close to the colors used on the background map
 *   - gray colour was added for emergency use
 *
 *   Also, it has been made so that black and crimson stand out, because these two are reserved in
 *   all overlays as having a special meaning

/*
 * Design considerations:
 * - use standard colour set, for consistency and for better support for colour-blind people
 *  - it is OK to use some extra colours if absolutely needed
 *
 * - red is reserved for missing data
 * - black is reserved for generic surface with note tag
 *
 * - similar surface should have similar colours
 *  - all paved ones are one such group
 *  - all unpaved ones are another
 *  - grass paver and compacted being high quality unpaved, unhewn cobblestone being low quality unpaved
 *    should be on border between these two groups
 *
 * - asphalt, concrete, paving stones are associated with grey
 *   but colouring these surfaces as grey resulted in really depressing, unfunny
 *   and soul-crushing display in cities where everything is well paved.
 *   Blue is more fun and less sad (while it will not convince anyone
 *   that concrete desert is a good thing).
 *
 * - highly unusual (for roads and paths) surfaces also got black colour
 * - due to running out of colors all well paved surfaces get the same colour
 * - due to running out of colours fine gravel, gravel, pebbles, rock got gray surface
 * - dashes were tested but due to limitation of Tangram were not working well and were
 *   incapable of replacing colour coding
 *
 * - ideally, sand would have colour close to yellow and grass colour close to green caused
 *   by extremely strong association between surface and colour

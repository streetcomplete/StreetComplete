     *  Example:
     *  A download of refreshed OSM data takes 10 seconds. While the download is executing, the user
     *  solves a quest (based on the previously downloaded data) which is immediately uploaded,
     *  resulting in the updated element to be persisted.
     *  When the download finally finishes, it got the data from 10 seconds ago, before the element
     *  has been updated. Thus, the old element overwrites the new one. */

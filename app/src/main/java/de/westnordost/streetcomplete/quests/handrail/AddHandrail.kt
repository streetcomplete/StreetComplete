/**
 * Only ask about whether there exists a handrail, not about the location (left, right and/or
 * middle), because the primary use case here is accessibility of the path (not 3d rendering, etc),
 * which does not depend on the location of the handrail.
 * The details would only slow down the answering in a survey by requiring more thought and a more
 * complex GUI (interpreting the direction of the OSM way for example).

    // does not make much sense for other types of elements and it is more likely to be a tagging
    // mistake.
    // Exclude elements tagged with `handrail:left`, `handrail:center` or `handrail:right`
    // even though according to the wiki page for `handrail=*` [1], the `handrail` tag should
    // always have just `yes` or `no` as a value to indicate the existence of a handrail somewhere.
    // If one of these tags is present but without a `handrail` tag, we still assume the survey data
    // itself was valid, so we do not need to use survey time to add the implied `handrail` tag.
    // If there is such a case, mappers can fix this from remote locations, maybe with the help of
    // one of the various Quality Assurance tools [3].

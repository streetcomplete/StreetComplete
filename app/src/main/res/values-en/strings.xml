    <!-- Privacy screen -->

    <string name="privacy_html">"&lt;p&gt;Ah, someone who cares about privacy, nice! I think I have only good news for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct Contributions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
First off, understand that with this app, you make actual and direct contributions to OpenStreetMap (OSM).&lt;br/&gt;
Anything you contribute in this app is directly added to the map, there is no third party in-between the app and OSM infrastructure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Editing OpenStreetMap anonymously is not possible. Any changes you make (and their date and location) are attributed to your OSM user account and publicly visible on the openstreetmap.org website. Because StreetComplete should only be used for on-site survey, this reveals where and when you have used the app.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The app does not share your GPS location with anyone. It is used to automatically scan for and download quests around you, and position the map at your location.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This app directly communicates with OSM servers.&lt;br/&gt;
Before uploading your changes, the app checks with a &lt;a href=\"https://www.westnordost.de/streetcomplete/banned_versions.txt\"&gt;simple text file&lt;/a&gt; on my server to ensure that this version of the app has not been banned from uploading changes. This is a precautionary measure to be able to block versions of the app that turn out to have critical bugs from uploading corrupted data to OSM.&lt;/p&gt;"</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_tileserver2">"&lt;p&gt;To display the map, vector tiles are retrieved from %1$s. See their &lt;a href=\"%2$s\"&gt;privacy statement&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;"</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_image_upload2">&lt;p&gt;Photos you attach to a note are uploaded to my server and deleted some days after that note has been resolved. Their meta-data is stripped before upload.&lt;/p&gt;</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_third_party_quest_sources">&lt;p&gt;For some quests, some additional data from third parties is downloaded. In particular, the oneway quest queries an API, also hosted on westnordost.de, about likely candidates for oneways.&lt;/p&gt;</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_statistics">&lt;p&gt;The data shown in your profile is aggregated from your publicly available contribution history to OpenStreetMap and then hosted on my server.&lt;/p&gt;</string>
    <string name="privacy_html_arcore">This application runs on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core"&gt;Google Play Services for AR&lt;/a&gt; (ARCore), which is provided by Google and governed by the &lt;a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy"&gt;Google Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.</string>

StreetComplete received a grant from the <a href="https://www.bmbf.de/">German Federal Ministry of Education and Research</a> within the frame of the <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/project/streetcomplete/">Prototype Fund</a>, spanning over a period of 6 months! For the next few months, my focus is on adding new quest types, starting with this update!</p><h3>New Quests</h3><ul><li><em>Is this a one-way street?

So now you can help not only to complete the map, but also to keep it up-to-date, which is at least as important.</p><p>Most prominently, you'll be asked if opening hours are still the same as before and be offered to correct them if they changed, the same with cycle tracks and lanes on roads.</p><p>This feature has been sponsored by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) as part of their new <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2020/07/01/osmf-microgrants-program-congratulations-to-selected-projects/">microgrants</a> program.

They are providing their vector map tiles service to StreetComplete for free!<br />
Their maps are also quite excellent: You can look forward to <strong>daily map updates</strong> and <strong>map loading times cut in half</strong>, as their map data is very lightweight.</p><p>But let's not forget to thank <a href="https://github.com/Akasch">Akasch</a> for hosting the previous solution with zero budget over the last years and maintaining it in his free time. Without his endeavor, there likely wouldn't have been a map at all in this time.</p><h3>Enhancements</h3><ul><li>Use adaptive launcher icon (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1928">#1928</a>), by <a href="https://github.com/pstorch">pstorch</a></li><li>The app can now be moved to SD card in the Android settings (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1787">#1787</a>), thanks <a href="https://github.com/Mortein">Mortein</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Atrate">Atrate</a></li><li>Labels for countries and big cities stand out more, so they are better distinguishable from smaller places</li><li>Accessibility: The text on the map now scales up when zooming and when increasing the font size in the Android settings (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1877">#1877</a>), by <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz">matkoniecz</a></li><li>Accessibility: Increase contrast for orange text (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1899">#1899</a>), by <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz">matkoniecz</a></li><li>Recycling type: Added cooking and motor oil options (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1830">#1830</a>)</li><li>Building type: Don't ask for (theme park) attractions (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1891">#1891</a>)</li><li>Added some achievement links</li></ul><h3>Fixes</h3><ul><li>Fix a crash for Finnish users (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1911">#1911</a>), by <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz">matkoniecz</a></li><li>Quest pins are not occluded by street names and other labels (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1905">#1905</a>, <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1906">#1906</a>, <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1908">#1908</a>, <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1927">#1927</a>, <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1930">#1930</a>), by <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz">matkoniecz</a></li><li>Fix display of compass rose for people with a larger system font size (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1916">#1916</a>), by <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz">matkoniecz</a></li><li>Fix animation of solved quest was cut off (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1910">#1910</a>)</li><li>Fix country flag for Costa Rica was missing</li></ul><h2>v20.1</h2><h3>Fixes and Enhancements</h3><ul><li>Workaround drawing problem with the location pin in Android 6 (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1879">#1879</a>), thanks <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz">matkoniecz</a></li><li>Fix crashy country bubble in statistics screen (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1886">#1886</a>)</li><li>Road name and bus name: Trim whitespace at start and end of user input (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1861">#1861</a>)</li><li>Crossing type: Don't ask for crossings that are not for pedestrians (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1868">#1868</a>), by <a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz">matkoniecz</a></li><li>Tactile paving on crossing: Don't ask for crossings that are not for pedestrians (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1875">#1875</a>)</li><li>House numbers: Don't ask the housenumber of buildings which are in a relation that already has a housenumber (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1860">#1860</a>)</li><li>Show tutorial again if user exits the app before finishing it (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1867">#1867</a>)</li><li>Max weight: Correct German translation (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1884">#1884</a>)</li><li>Address street: Do not show immediately after answering the housenumber quest but only after next download (<a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1856">#1856</a>).

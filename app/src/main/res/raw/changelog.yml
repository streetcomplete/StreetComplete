v51.0: |
  <h3>Standalone measuring app</h3>
  <p>Measuring distances with the camera has been outsourced into a standalone app, so you can also measure things outside of the context of solving quests: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.westnordost.streetmeasure">StreetMeasure</a></p>
  <p>This has been done for licensing reasons (see #4289). In a nutshell, ARCore (= <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core">Google Play Services for AR</a>), on which the measuring is dependent on, is not open source.<br>
     This is why it is also not available on the main repo in F-Droid. If you do not have Google Play, you can <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetMeasure/releases">download the APK from GitHub</a>, but then you also need to install ARCore.</p>

v32.0: |
  <p>
  The grant from the <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/project/streetcomplete/">Prototype Fund</a>
  ended in February, however, there is one last big mega-update I can delight you with before development
  on this app must necessarily wind down:<br/>
  It may not look like a lot, but I basically replaced the whole architecture of the app (#2506, ...)
  to do this. Note that this required dropping most local data, such as unsynced edits, downloaded
  quests and statistics.<br/>Special thanks to @FloEdelmann for helping with the refactor.
  </p>
  <h3>🔙️ Superpowered Undo</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    You can now <b>undo any edit</b> that hasn't been uploaded yet:<br/>
    quest answers, split ways, deleted places, hidden quests, created notes and note comments (#1029, #2616)
  </li>
  <li>You can now look at your <b>edit history</b> and undo any recent edit in any order, not just the last one</li>
  <li>It is now shown what exactly is tagged for each edit in the edit history</li>
  <li>You can now undo deletions of places even after you have uploaded it (#2441)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>⛰️ Improved usability and offline mode</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
  Immediately unlock new quests based on the one you just solved, <b>even when
  offline</b>. This has been a much requested feature but was simply not possible with the previous
  architecture (#1369, #1510, #1550, #1826, #2254, #2438, #2473, #2474, #2676, #2743...)
  </li>
  <li>
  The above also works when splitting a way. The quests for the split segments will be shown
  immediately
  </li>
  <li>When you scan for quests manually, no cache will be used: you always get the freshest data (#2554)</li>
  <li>When unable to fully upload pictures attached to a note due to a bad connection, the app will try again later (#2102)</li>
  </ul>

  Good News! StreetComplete received a grant from the <a href="https://www.bmbf.de/">German Federal Ministry of Education and Research</a> within the frame of the <a href="https://prototypefund.de/en/project/streetcomplete/">Prototype Fund</a>,
  spanning over a period of 6 months! For the next few months, my focus is on adding new quest types, starting with this update!
  </p>
  <h3>New Quests</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><i>Is this a one-way street? In which direction?</i> (#1982, #2122)</li>

  </ul>

v23.0: |
  <h3>🚧 Map maintenance</h3>
  Quest types whose answer is likely to change over the years will be asked again in reasonable
  intervals. So now you can help not only to complete the map, but also to keep it up-to-date,
  which is at least as important.
  <br/><br/>
  Most prominently, you'll be asked if opening hours are still the same as before and be offered to
  correct them if they changed, the same with cycle tracks and lanes on roads.
  <br/><br/>
  This feature has been sponsored by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) as part of their new
  <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2020/07/01/osmf-microgrants-program-congratulations-to-selected-projects/">microgrants</a> program.
  You can support the OSMF and other initiatives like these and have a say by <a href="https://join.osmfoundation.org/">becoming a member</a>, if you like.

  The microgrant proposal <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Microgrants/Microgrants_2020/Proposal/Map_Maintenance_with_StreetComplete">Map maintenance with StreetComplete</a>
  is one of the <a href="https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2020/07/01/osmf-microgrants-program-congratulations-to-selected-projects/">12 projects selected for funding by the OpenStreetMap Foundation</a>!
  <br>

  <h3>🗺️ New Map Provider</h3>
  <p>Big thanks to <a href="https://www.jawg.io">JawgMaps</a>, a provider of online
   custom maps, geocoding and routing based on OpenStreetMap data. They are providing their vector
   map tiles service to StreetComplete for free! <br/>
   Their maps are also quite excellent:
   You can look forward to <strong>daily map updates</strong> and <strong>map loading
   times cut in half</strong>, as their map data is very lightweight.</p>
  <p>But let's not forget to thank @Akasch for hosting the previous solution with zero budget over
   the last years and maintaining it in his free time. Without his endeavor, there likely wouldn't
   have been a map at all in this time.</p>
  <h3>Enhancements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use adaptive launcher icon (#1928), by @pstorch</li>
    <li>The app can now be moved to SD card in the Android settings (#1787), thanks @Mortein and @Atrate</li>

  <p>This one is a huge release, maybe the biggest one yet! But don't get used to it, I have been
  working on it full-time for a few months but must soon return to work life as my savings are running low.

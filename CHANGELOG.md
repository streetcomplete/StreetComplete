### üó∫Ô∏è MapLibre (#5693), by @Helium314 and me

Migrated from the map renderer tangram-es to [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/). The former has effectively been unmaintained for quite a few years and does not support modern iOS, this solves some long-standing display and crash issues.

Display-wise, nothing much *should* change, the map will just look and behave a little different.

Issues solved by the migration are #5601, #5241, #5216, #5161, #5146, #5137, #5048, #5027, #5006, #4844, #4830, #4556, #4554, #4550, #4542, #4522, #4277, #4259, #4026, #3417, #3397, #3346, #3275, #3022, #2878, #2711, #2703, #2612, #2571, #2373, #2359, #2358, #2187, #1713, #1684, #1264, #1019, #869, #807, #318, #179, [mapstyle#119](https://github.com/streetcomplete/streetcomplete-mapstyle/issues/119), [mapstyle#56](https://github.com/streetcomplete/streetcomplete-mapstyle/issues/56)... maybe more. Thanks to @riQQ for this list.

### üçè iOS progress

In case you wondered what happened since I [announced to work on an iOS version of the app](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/westnordost/diary/403704). I've taken some big steps forward, see [this progress update](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/5421#issuecomment-2332402123) for more info.
Most of it is behind the scenes, but what's visible is the completely redone UI for the settings screens, about screens, statistics screens and tutorial screens (#5719, #5855). Of course, it looks mostly the same now, as it should.

### New Quests

### Removed Quests

### Buildings Overlay (#5461)

The new Buildings overlay now lets you comprehensively view and edit building types all around town,
color-coded for your convenience!
Conversely, the building type quest is disabled by default now as it was really spammy, don't you think?

(You'll be amazed and/or appalled how many buildings are currently actually tagged wrong or imprecise! üòÖ)

### Things Overlay (#4912), thanks @matkoniecz

The new Things overlay allows you to map all those small map features like benches, bicycle parkings,
roadside trees, ATMs and other street furniture in general.

It complements the Places Overlay which has been renamed from Shop overlay because it now also lets
you map places that are not shops - like hotels, hospitals, schools and so forth. (#5152)

## v56.1

Some work towards an [iOS port](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/5421) of
StreetComplete has begun - starting with making the code more platform independent for now.
(Monitor the linked tickets for updates, because non user-facing changes are usually not
mentioned in the changelogs)

### Unmaintained translations

Translations to Turkish, Malayalam, Amharic, Armenian, Bosnian, Norwegian Nyorsk, Galician and Japanese haven't been maintained for over half a year.

As a native speaker of any of these languages, you can [help translate the app](https://poeditor.com/join/project/IE4GC127Ki) in order to retain this translation in the app.

To avoid an awkward mix of properly localized and English texts all over the app that wouldn't be usable by people who do not understand both languages, languages whose translation completeness becomes too low are removed from the app and only re-added when they reach near 100% again.

## v53.2

## v51.0

### Standalone measuring app

Measuring distances with the camera has been outsourced into a standalone app, so you can also measure things outside of the context of solving quests: [StreetMeasure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.westnordost.streetmeasure)

This has been done for licensing reasons (see #4289). In a nutshell, ARCore (= [Google Play Services for AR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core)), on which the measuring is dependent on, is not open source.  
 This is why it is also not available on the main repo in F-Droid. If you do not have Google Play, you can [download the APK from GitHub](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetMeasure/releases), but then you also need to install ARCore.

### New Quests

- _"Is this also here outside of winter?"_, asked for grit bins (#4749, #4754), by @FloEdelmann

## v32.0

The grant from the [Prototype Fund](https://prototypefund.de/en/project/streetcomplete/) ended in February, however, there is one last big mega-update I can delight you with before development on this app must necessarily wind down:  
It may not look like a lot, but I basically replaced the whole architecture of the app (#2506, ...) to do this. Note that this required dropping most local data, such as unsynced edits, downloaded quests and statistics.  
Special thanks to @FloEdelmann for helping with the refactor.

### üîôÔ∏è Superpowered Undo

## v29.0

### üó∫Ô∏è Map available offline!

In the area quests are downloaded, the background map is now also downloaded into the cache.

So, when you are offline later, you can continue to use this app in that area without any problem because the background is also available (#122, #2428).

To download not at your current GPS location but somewhere else, just pan and zoom to that location and tap "search for quests here" in the menu.

For the next few months, my focus is on adding new quest types, starting with this update!

### üöß Map maintenance

Quest types whose answer is likely to change over the years will be asked again in reasonable intervals. So now you can help not only to complete the map, but also to keep it up-to-date, which is at least as important.

Most prominently, you'll be asked if opening hours are still the same as before and be offered to correct them if they changed, the same with cycle tracks and lanes on roads.

This feature has been sponsored by the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) as part of their new [microgrants](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2020/07/01/osmf-microgrants-program-congratulations-to-selected-projects/) program. You can support the OSMF and other initiatives like these and have a say by [becoming a member](https://join.osmfoundation.org/), if you like.

### üó∫Ô∏è New Map Provider

Big thanks to [JawgMaps](https://www.jawg.io), a provider of online custom maps, geocoding and routing based on OpenStreetMap data. They are providing their vector map tiles service to StreetComplete for free!  
Their maps are also quite excellent: You can look forward to **daily map updates** and **map loading times cut in half**, as their map data is very lightweight.

But let's not forget to thank @Akasch for hosting the previous solution with zero budget over the last years and maintaining it in his free time. Without his endeavor, there likely wouldn't have been a map at all in this time.

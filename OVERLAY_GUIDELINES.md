Do you have an idea for a new overlay? Read this!

First of all, the same general limitations and guidelines as for quests apply, see the [quest guidelines](QUEST_GUIDELINES.md). Additionally, data is only eligible for an overlay if:

### Overlay guidelines

- 🕸️ **Contextual only**: Overlays should only be used to display data that only makes sense in relation to neighboring data, e.g. data in a network (such as cycleways, speed limits, ...) or data that depends (to a degree) how surrounding data is tagged (such as road smoothness, lit status, ...).
- 🔎 **One aspect**: Similar to the atomic quests guideline, only one aspect should be displayed and be editable to the user.
- ⭐ **Not a quest**: Usually eligible data should *either* be recorded and displayed in an overlay *or* as a quest.

The concept of overlays is very similar to the core concept of [MapComplete](https://mapcomplete.osm.be/) which doesn't impose such restrictions.

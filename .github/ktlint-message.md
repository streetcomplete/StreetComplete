This project follows the [official Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html). We use [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) to check that, and unfortunately, there is some code that violates the code style. Please go to this PR's *Files* tab and have a look at the inline annotations in the code. To see a list of all lint issues, click *Details* near the failing "‚ùå Lint / Kotlin" check below.

You can fix most issues automatically by [reformatting the code in Android Studio](https://stackoverflow.com/q/40926920).  
Even more issues are fixed automatically by [installing ktlint locally](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint#installation) and running `ktlint --format` in the project root directory.

This message will disappear once all lint issues are fixed. If anything is unclear, don't hesitate to ask!

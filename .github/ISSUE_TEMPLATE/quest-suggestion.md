<!-- 
Please read the guidelines for new quest suggestions before posting one: 
https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/blob/master/QUEST_GUIDELINES.md

Also please search existing issues (both open and closed) to see if such quest was already suggested before.
-->

### General
Affected tag(s) to be modified/added: [](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:)
Question asked: **Is there an example tag on item XY?**

<!-- If the answer is not obvious, please add a short explanation below each item. -->
### Checklist
Checklist for quest suggestions (see [guidelines](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/blob/master/QUEST_GUIDELINES.md)):
- [ ] 🚧 To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose
- [ ] 🤔 Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging (Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one)
- [ ] 🐿️ Easily answerable by any pedestrian from the outside but a survey is necessary
- [ ] 💤 Not an overwhelming percentage of quests have the same answer (No spam)
- [ ] 🕓 Applies to a reasonable number of map data (Worth the effort)

<!--
All of the above should be fulfilled. 
If you are not sure about how one condition applies to your suggestion or you have (very) strong reasons that a condition may not needed to be satisfied in your case, just note that down. Someone else may come up with some ideas.

### Ideas for implementation

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. -->
**Element selection:** 

<!-- If you have any idea whether metadata per country is needed, add it here. If you know where to get this data from, mention it here too -->
**Metadata needed:** 

<!-- If you have any idea on how the UI (the form appearing when the quest is asked) should look like.
You can use any way to propose a UI. Feel free to include a mockup. 
Do include all answer possibilities you consider for that quest. -->
**Proposed UI:**

<!--
If you are not suggesting a new quest, ignore this issue template. Otherwise we kindly ask you to fill it out.

Guidelines for quest suggestions: https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/wiki/Adding-new-Quests-to-StreetComplete
-->

### General
Affected tag(s) to be modified/added: [](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:)
Question asked: **Is there an example tag on item XY?**

<!-- If the answer is not obvious, please append a short explanation to each item (or, if it is longer, below), explaining the reason. -->
### Checklist
Checklist for quest suggestions (see guidelines):
- [ ] 🚧 To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose
- [ ] 🤔 Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging (Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one)
- [ ] 🐿️ Easily answerable by everyone from the outside but a survey is necessary 
- [ ] 💤 Not an overwhelming percentage of elements have the same answer (No spam)
- [ ] 🕓 Applies to a reasonable number of elements (Worth the effort)

<!--
Please try to satisfy all conditions. If one cannot be satisfied that may prevent your quest from getting included in StreetComplete.
If you are not sure about how one condition applies to your suggestion or you have (very) strong reasons that a condition may not needed to be satisfied in your case, just note that down. Someone else may come up with some ideas.

### Ideas for implementation
<!-- If you do not have any, just delete this part. ;)  -->

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. Possibly include an overpass-api query if you are sure what you do. -->
**Element selection:** 

<!-- If you have any idea whether metadata per country is needed, add it here. If you even have ideas, where to get this data from, you can of course also mention it! -->
**Metadata needed:** 

<!-- If you have any idea on how the GUI (the form appearing when the quest is asked) should look like. (i.e. whether a simple yes/no answer is suitable or what else you imagine) You can use any way to propose a UI. Use simple markdown tables (https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables/) or complex image mockups. That's your decision.
Do include all answer possibilities you consider for that quest. -->
**Proposed GUI:**

![StreetComplete](http://www.westnordost.de/streetcomplete/featureGraphic.png)

An Android app which finds wrong, incomplete or extendable data in the user's vicinity and provides the tools to complete these easily and directly on site without having to use another editor.

The found issues are presented to the user as markers on a map (like i.e. in Osmose) that each are
solvable by filling out a simple form to complete/correct the information on site. The user's
answer is then processed and directly uploaded into the OSM database in meaningful changesets in the name
of the user's OSM account.
Since the app is meant to be used on a survey, it can be used offline and otherwise aims to be
economic with data usage.

The app is aimed at users who do not know anything about OSM tagging schemes but still want to
contribute to the OpenStreetMap by surveying their neighbourhood (or other places as well). Because of the target group, only those quests are shown which are answerable very clearly by asking one simple question and only those quests are created which contain very few false positives.

## Quests

Right now, there are very few different question types. More will be added over time.
You can see a community-managed [list of all quests in the OSM wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete/Quests).

If you have ideas for new quest types, please read this guide: [Adding new Quests to StreetComplete](https://github.com/westnordost/StreetComplete/wiki/Adding-new-Quests-to-StreetComplete).

If you would like to help and are able to contribute code, you are most welcome.
I have a few tasks in mind that would be very helpful for the project, some of which do not require knowledge about the current code base. So best get in touch with me.

Otherwise, there are many reasonable feature requests and ideas for new question types in the issue tracker which you could also engage yourself with.
If you have own ideas how to improve this app and want to make sure that I will merge your Pull Request, I suggest you open an issue first in which the feature can be discussed.

You can help with [processing OSM notes opened by StreetComplete users](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/?query=StreetComplete&limit=100&start=true). With this tool, you can also find systematic problems or misunderstandings introduced through (users of) StreetComplete and report them back here.

Finally, using it, testing it and giving constructive feedback is also a valuable contribution.

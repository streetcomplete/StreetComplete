# Validation evidence

Validation claims in this file distinguish compilation, automated tests, and
interactive runtime evidence. A compile result is not treated as proof of feature
parity.

## Baseline: upstream master at `c778f48b1`

Environment: macOS 26.6.2 ARM64, Temurin 25.0.4, Gradle 9.7.1.

| Target | Command | Result | What it proves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Common | `./gradlew :app:compileCommonMainKotlinMetadata` | Pass | Shared source compiles as metadata. |
| Android library | `./gradlew :app:compileAndroidMain` | Pass | Existing Android library source compiles. |
| Android app | `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug` | Pass | Existing Android debug APK assembles. |
| iOS simulator | `./gradlew :app:compileKotlinIosSimulatorArm64` | Pass | Existing iOS source compiles; the product app is still only a temporary launcher. |
| Desktop | n/a | Missing | No desktop target or application exists at baseline. |

The baseline Gradle configuration also warns that `androidUnitTest` is declared
but not attached to a compilation. This must be corrected before final validation.

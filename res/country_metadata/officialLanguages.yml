# list of languages spoken and written by country
# ordered by:
# 1. statewide official (used by government)
# 2. spoken trade languages / lingua franca(s) if the official language does not do the job
# 3. spoken national majority languages in mother tongue by importance 
# 4. languages spoken by a clear minority only if it spoken by the majority in their region and enjoys some official recognition (i.e. language used on signs) there
# a good source (which doesn't make a distinction between spoken natively and spoken in general though which this list tries to make, so additional research is necessary): http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_language_information.html

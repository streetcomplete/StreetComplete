# "White on curb" is actually a passenger loading zone, which requires a more detailed 
# tagging (parking:condition:reason=passenger_loading_zone). Mappers in California prefer that
# this option is not displayed at all as long as there is not explicit support to project that,
# i.e. this would go into a file named passengerLoadingZoneLineStyle.yml

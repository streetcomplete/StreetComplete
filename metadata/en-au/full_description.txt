Help improve OpenStreetMap with StreetComplete!

This application finds missing map data in your vicinity and displays it on a map as quests. Solve each quest by visiting the location on-site and answering a simple question to update the map.

The info you enter is directly added to OpenStreetMap in your name without the need to use another editor.
